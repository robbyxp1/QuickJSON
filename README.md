# QuickJSON
QuickJSON - a c# JSON encoder/decoder - Small, simple, quick

Aim is to be 
1) Quicker than the JSON decoder commonly used in C# 
2) Be simple to understand - no spagetti of classes
3) Be small with only a few files - so you can copy the code into your codebase and not have to have yet another dependent DLL to go along with your deployment
